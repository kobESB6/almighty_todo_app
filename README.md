# The Almighty TODO (Task Board Management App)

Overview
This project is a Task Board Management Application designed to help teams track and manage project tasks visually. Using jQuery, jQuery UI, and Day.js, this app provides an intuitive interface for creating, organizing, and managing tasks. Tasks are displayed in a Kanban-style board and can be dragged between columns to represent their progress (To Do, In Progress, Done). The app also uses localStorage to persist tasks across sessions.
